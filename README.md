# Vector-auto-regression

Overview
This project implements a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model for forecasting multivariate time series data. VAR is a statistical model used to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series.

Features
VAR Model Implementation: Core implementation of the VAR model to forecast multiple interrelated time series data.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and transformation techniques tailored for time series data.

Model Evaluation: Techniques to evaluate the forecasting performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

Visualization: Tools for plotting time series data and forecast results for analysis.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels
